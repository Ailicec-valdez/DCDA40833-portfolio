            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>This data visualization diagram is called Missing Migrants created by Soha Elghany, a data visualization designer, who focuses her work on humanizing data through her diagrams. This specific visualization was created as a means to track people who have died or went missing during the process of migration to other countries. According to the artist, each spiral represents a migration route and each mark along it corresponds to an individual incident. Based on my analysis and interpretation, I would say the translation is clear when explained thoroughly. The visualization is difficult to understand initially because of the amount of information being translated to us, but once reading the points made on the visualization and the artist's explanation I could better understand the gravity of the issue involved. The creator explained her methods of making data visualization less about pure statistics and more about humanity and empathy. Through artistic interpretation I believe the visualization adds more than what a mere graph will do. I personally think it was a good idea to label the color of the dots by the origin country, it allows for the readers to realize the hardship some vulnerable communities are going through when migrating. It could also bring up other questions like; are these results due to specific issues within the country of origin?  Or are the low numbers of some countries due to there being a lower population of people migrating? 
    Unfortunately, there are still a lot of issues that come with an artistic version of data visualization. A big one being a lack of clarity like we see here. We are told that each spiral is a route that someone went missing on and we’re given a smaller diagram/key under that relates to the spirals but it doesn’t clearly identify what it means. There is a lack of comprehensibility when initially analysing the data in this visualization, therefore the artistic interpretation can obscure what the data is trying to convey. We briefly discussed Edward Tufte's principles of visualization, focusing on how data is represented in different methods. In this example, the work of Elghany does a pretty decent job with keeping consistency in her design choices. This allowed for low distractions and clarity. Elghany also maintained contextual integrity by providing all relevant data. By doing so, she was able to show a difference in statistics drawing the readers to the significant changes between data points.

            <h3><strong> Manipulation vs Engagement:</strong></h3>
            <p>
Missing Migrants was created to highlight human emotion through the data presented. Soha Elghany’s goal was to honor each life as more than just a statistic. She did this by adding valuable information to each dot, this represented the lives lost through each journey of migration. As a reader I do consider this work using emotion to further deepen the understanding of the information it wants to inform us about.

            <h3><strong>Accessibility:</strong></h3>
            <p>The platform where this data visualization was created is Tableau Public. This software is a public platform open to anyone that seeks to create and share data visualizations. According to its website, this free platform connects a global community through its accessibility on different devices. Due to Missing Migrants being located in Tableau Public this visualization is not exclusive to a singular audience. 
</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Soha Elghany’s visualization, Missing Migrants, is one of several artistic data visualizations that use emotional metaphors to connect the audience to the information being conveyed. While an artistic approach to data visualization can create several issues, like unclarity or lack of comprehensibility, the data visualization designer can enhance the amount of context given to the reader. Elghany’s work was able to create a balance of emotional impact to the informational aim, showing how artistic data visualization can inform beyond statistics and create meaningful awareness to its audience.
