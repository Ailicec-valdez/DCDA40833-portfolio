               Today, I want to create an image carousel to attach to my lab05. I will be using AI functions to help guide me and create the code needed to correctly display these functions in my html. I will be writing a series of clear prompts to the generator to achieve the best results.

       font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;
       }
    
    </style>

    <p1> <strong>Prompt 1</strong>
         “I would like to create an image carousel in my Lab05.html. The carousel will be interactive and display all images in a creative and organized way. I would like it to include 5 images.”

    </p1>
    <p1> <strong>Prompt 2</strong>
“How can I align the carousel to the center?”
    </p1>
            <p>
              By making sure my prompt is clear I can ensure the best results. I used two prompts, one to get the result of the carousel and the other to help me with structure. I enjoyed that the generator gave me my results with suggestions.

            For this lab I decided to take experiment A, option 3: creating a photo carousel. This function features 5 of my favorite bird pictures I've taken. I created a prompt that generated an interactive photo element on the top of my lab html that displays these 5 images. When learning about vibe coding I was intrigued by its easy usage. Vibe coding is an approach that allows users to generate applications through the description of requirements. Overall I found the software pretty easy to move through. My prompt stated “I would like to create an image carousel in my Lab05.html. The carousel will be interactive and display all images in a creative and organized way. I would like it to include 5 images.” I wanted to make my description as clear as I could and this is what I noticed. The software was able to create a function that showed what I wanted to create. There were only small issues that I noticed, some being a change of template color. For some reason it turned my website page blue instead of its regular purple tone, but that was an easy fix. Other  issues included small organizational bugs like not centering the carousel. I used the AI agent again to help me determine what was wrong. I loved how it gave me three different options even though it stated the program has already been set to be centered. It reminds me that when it comes to the python language there are several different fixes to minor issues. Besides that I didn’t see any other abnormal structure to the function or visualization. 
    AI was helpful when I didn’t know where to start. When it comes to python and computer softwares I struggle often with finding where to begin my function. I like that AI makes it accessible to get you started while explaining the changes it has made. This also helps me learn through example and allows me to expand the function by just creating the initial base of the program. Even though AI can be useful it is not something to blindly rely on. AI does create the base of your function but it isn’t always perfect and often you must expand and analyze what is given to you. AI is a tool you can use, not something to depend on. Many of the functions programmed through AI can project themselves as errors, especially if it completely changes what you’ve already created. This was recognized in this lab when the created function changed the aesthetics of my website. That is why you must always be wary of the changes created by AI and continue to make your work uniquely yours through your design, ethics, and knowledge. 
      Personally I think vibe coding can help your development as a programmer but only when used correctly. I stated previously that I enjoy learning through example so that I can apply them later on. That is how I feel we can best learn from the vibe coding system. AI is a tool that is still being developed, it should only be used as an extra help. Now, what if you need to cite AI? That is an interesting question that programmers are still trying to figure out. It's important to mention and properly cite the AI software used for your work. This can be done similarly to how we cite academic journals or other websites, including name, model, and version if available.
Your guidelines: What personal rules will you follow for using AI in coding? When will you use it? When won't you?
I have a few personal rules for myself. Firstly, always question whether AI is actually needed at this moment? I think it is important not to rely on AI when not needed. I am an environmental scientist and my relationship with AI is a bit rocky. I want to make sure that if I am using AI I am using it appropriately and for a reason not just because. As far as learning python, my number one rule is personally try the function yourself first and then if you need the help use AI softwares.
