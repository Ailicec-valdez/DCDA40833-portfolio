        <h1>AI Experimentation</h1>

        <p><strong>First Prompt:</strong> The first prompt stated 'Can you create an image of an animation in the style of Tim Burton or Coraline. The setting is set in a national park with lots of trees and plants. Add a grizzly bear and a camp site.  Can the primary colors be green, purple, dark blues, and gold/yellow.' </p>
        <p><strong>Second Prompt</strong> The second prompt stated 'Can you create an art work in the style of Claude Monet (oil paints). Let it be of a beautiful lake view, including a lake house and prairie land and tall grass. Add flowers and make it a sunny setting. Make it as realistic as oil painting can be.'</p>

            <h2>What I Tried</h2>
            <p> Today, I tried two AI softwares that I have never used before. These include Adobe Firefly and Leonardo.io. I decided to explore both of these because I am aware that both these programs work great in making creative images based on the prompts given to them. I ran two different experiments, the first one related to animation. There has been talks about the new style animators use, asking the question: is AI being used to create the new animated movies? I wanted to see if it was possible for these softwares are able to create clear and interesting looking animations based on popular styles. The second experiment related to art. AI has become an ongoing controversy, especially in the art community, having people wonder if it is possible that AI can take artist jobs in the future. My second prompt wanted to see if AI could replicate a similar art style from a famous artist and if we are able to tell.

            <h2>What Happened</h2>
            <p>First experiment:  I was thoroughly surprised with the results of Adobe Firefly. I think it outputs a creative image that I could see being in future films. It was interesting to see what different details it added and it was fairly easy to work. As for Leonardo, the output was more of a generic image. Although the prompt asked for similar styles to Tim Burton or Coraline, I don’t think Leonardo.io created that with the explanation I gave. 
Second experiment: Both of these outputs surprised me by how similar they were to each other. It made me question if there was a specific painting it was relating to or if it was generating the most basic outcome. I was intrigued by the similarities of colors and positions of the setting, like how the lake house looked and what side the lake was and which side the house was. I didn’t see any specific errors occurring but based on quality, Leonardo.io still had more of a cartoony look even though I stated to be realistic.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>My experiments revealed that AI could have a potential drive to change the way art and movies are created but it will not solely happen through simple actions. I think human interaction and art will still be greatly needed and it should be. I have read about common biases found in AI generated images, including societal, gender and racial bias. I did see some of these biases on the images but they weren’t too “loud” as one may think.

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>I believe AI has the potential to be an incredible tool, but I don’t think it should be used for everything. As I continue my academic and professional work I hope to use AI as a tool that helps with my brainstorming and organization. One thing I use AI for is to help me with python or any kind of coding, it becomes an essential instrument that helps programmers understand where they might have gone wrong. As an Environmental Scientist I am equally aware of the potential damages that can happen with the growth of AI usage and that is why I can’t support everyday use for simple prompts. I would love to learn more about what keeps these software connected and just how much energy is required to keep them working. As AI continues to become such a prominent staple in our society, I hope to understand its important contributions and how I, as a user, can be mindful of the way I utilize this piece of technology.
</p>
<p>When utilizing AI one should always ask:
Do I truly need to use AI right now?
How reliable is this information?
Is there a way I can help the software better curate its responses to me?
How can I double check its responses?
