            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
            <p><strong>Who I am: </strong> I am Ailicec Valdez, a senior Environmental Science and Digital Culture & Data Analytics double-major. One interesting fact about me is that I've studied abroad in South Africa.</p>

            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> My interest and hobbies include photography and conservation education, as well as some graphic design. What drew me to DCDA was the variety of classes that could broaden my personal and career skills.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> I hope to gain skills in python and code. I also believe humanities and science go hand-in-hand and I know that through DCDA I am able to expand on both.</p>
